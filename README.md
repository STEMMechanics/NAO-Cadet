# Welcome
![NAO Cadet Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STEMMechanics/NAO-Cadet/main/.github/img/banner.png)

NAO Cadet was created back in 2018 for the purpose of:

- Teaching young kids how to code a NAO robot using a familar block based system
- Allowing the product to work across multiple platforms (computer, tablets)
- Kids can code from multiple devices and run on the same NAO robot

Over time, it has grown to support:

- User accounts
- Multiple domains or locations
- Template scripts
- Hiding advanced robot feature blocks to simplify the interface
- Support for v6 NAOs (from version 1.1.0 onwards)

> **NOTE:** Only the virtual robot in Choregraphe 2.8 is supported due to dependencies not present in version 2.1

## 🛟 Limited Support

Support and updates to this software is now limited due to time commitments and no longer having access to the NAO ecosystem.

## 🖥️ Installation

To use NAO Cadet, you first need to install the `naocadet.crg` file onto your robot using the Choregraphe 2.8 program. Then once installed. it can be launched by speaking the word  *Cadet*.

Connect your browser to the web address announced by the NAO.

> The default **admin** password is **admin**. It is recommended that you first login as admin and change this password.
